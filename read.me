# ILR-Based Multilingual Language Assessment App

This project is an AI-powered application for evaluating spoken language proficiency based on the Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) scale. It supports transcription, language detection, heuristic ILR analysis, and personalized feedback.

## Features

- ✅ Upload and transcribe `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.m4a` audio files
- ✅ Analyze spoken responses using [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)
- ✅ Detect spoken language automatically
- ✅ Estimate ILR proficiency level (1-5)
- ✅ Provide automated feedback based on ILR level
- ✅ Mic-based recording interface (optional in future versions)

## Setup

```bash
# Clone repo
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/llm-ilr-assessment.git

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv ilr-env
source ilr-env/bin/activate  # or .\ilr-env\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- ffmpeg (included in folder or system PATH)
- Internet connection (for Whisper model loading)

---

## Notes

- Whisper base model is used for transcription.
- ILR estimation is based on word count and language detection.
- For serious ILR-level diagnostics, human evaluation is still recommended.
